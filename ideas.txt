Have the communications from client be compressed via a different encryption type than the server sides
Have server side receive encrypted messages 

broad idea: have three different encryption methods, and have a keyword with every sent message, this way the client side randomly picks one of *however many types of encryption there is* using import random, and then the server side decrypts each one and then whichever one presents the key word, server side uses, and then continues forward with information
Add secret 'dev mode' where you can have the program log the communications, and run the server side on your own computer for testing and other things.
