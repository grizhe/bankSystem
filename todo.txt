THIS IS A GRAND TODO LIST - THESE ARE ALL POSSIBLE UPDATES FOR THE PROGRAM.

- security feature that 'sanitizes' username and password inputs before entry:
    (removes special characters that could be used for injection, and just submits the strings entered before that)
    -have the client side send a signal in said message that notifies the server to log said input, with the ip adress, message, and username associated with the ip address.
    - this will require the server to send a message back that will have the client, in return, send the username - unhashed. Allowing the administrators to further
        understand who was trying to breach their system.
