this was all notes that are no longer necessary:

todo items left for the program before completion, and 'release' of 1.0

server - 
have server reply with 'invform' short for invalid-format, when the format is invalid.

test -
- if the server replies that the format is invalid, have the user redo their inputs.

from here, update client/client.py to reform to the code that is therefore set by the interactions between test.py, and server.py 

let's hope to spend less than one week before the version 1.0 can be 'released'
