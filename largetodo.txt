--- finish software side (more information in todo.txt)
--- commit to github (v1.0)
--- start production of server side
	goals for server side:
		hold all accounts in a .txt
		have a program constantly running that can view, add accounts, and pull and update information in said .txt file
		have a custom or rarely used number/hash encoder/decoder


*once server side is completed, begin progress on making the application pretty*
