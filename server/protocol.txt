command username password userquery secnumber

socket -> server:
1 - session or no session
if session
    2 = session id
    3 = query

2 = username
3 = password
4 = query
5 = secnum (may or may not be presented)





1 - f.toomanyattempts
2, 3, 5 - f.verify ( requires username, passoword, and secnum to be verified by the program
3 - withdrawl
4 - deposit (requires low verification as
5 - bal
6 - userCreator


create session id encoding, and decrypt with sessionIdDecrypter(sessionID)

username, password, - hashed
secnum, deposit, withdraw, read account number, - encrpyted utf8

create a shitton of fake information to add into the database using a python program

look into creating webpage-like / frontend / whatever its called, could be really cool


-----------------------------------------this actually works---------------------------
import mariadb

conn = mariadb.connect(
    user="root",
    password="a",
    host="localhost",
    port=3306,
    database="accounts")

cur = conn.cursor()

print(cur.execute("SELECT username FROM accounts"))
for user in cur:
    print(user)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cur.execute("INSERT INTO accounts (username, password) VALUES ('joshw', 'lukrayden')")
conn.commit()

server protocol shall be set to only require the username, and password. The second function per user will then

new login function will require only the username and password.

once logged in, create and return a session to the user. 
create a sessions table that stores the ip, username, and password

the session will be randomly generated, (check to see if session id is already in use)

create a function that declares if the user has done something, that will reset a timer,
if user does not
